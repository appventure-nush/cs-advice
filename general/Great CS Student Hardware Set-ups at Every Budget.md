# Great CS Student Hardware Set-ups at Every Budget

In general, you don't need all that much money for equipment when it comes to CS, perhaps contrary to popular belief. If the school computer lab laptops can run something, chances are your potato can as well, but if you want to improve productivity in order to dedicate your time on more important things such as watching anime, then you need a decent rig.



## Some General Points

The only modules that actually require a decent GPU for productivity purposes is probably Android development in Y4S1 and maybe machine learning in Y5S1. For all other modules, a decent CPU, copious amounts of RAM and an SSD is really all you need in the box. What's really important and what often gets neglected are monitors. For best price-to-performance ratio, two monitors should be ideal. (Use a monitor arm (~$30) for your secondary one) I would personally go for 1440p monitors (perhaps with high refresh rate should you want to game), which go for around $350 new apiece.

As a rule of thumb, things you touch and see, i.e. monitor and peripherals would usually make a far greater impact on productivity per dollar than what's under the hood.



## My Recommendations at Common Budgets
### $1000
Anything lower than this, and you should probably just stick to whatever you have currently and use the school computer lab computers.
You obviously can't afford a separate laptop/desktop combo here, so you'd have to go for one or the other.



#### Laptop
Laptops cost a lot more than desktops for the same specs, and frankly one would spend 80% of their time on a CS project at home. In my 4 years of existence within the confines of this establishment, I've only absolutely needed a laptop in school once or twice, and that was for a MUN conference, so I'd strongly advise against getting one when you only have 1k to spare.

That being said, the new AMD Ryzen CPUs are better than traditional Intel ones in pretty much every regard, whether it be the U- or H-suffix lineup. **Stay away from Dell XPS as those products have horrendous quality control** and you should be good to go.

Something with 16 GB of RAM and a 512 GB SSD would be abundant. You would be able to run Chrome alongside a heavy-duty IDE without many issues, and executables generally don't hog that much space. You can even go with a 256 GB one if you're feeling frisky. 

Screen-size-wise, the larger the better unless you have a bad back and can't carry the weight of a 15-inch laptop along with your burdens.

##### Recommendations
https://www.lenovo.com/sg/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-t-series/ThinkPad-T14-AMD-G1/p/20UDCTO1WWENSG0 This isn't a half-bad deal, and you can even go on HardwareZone for even more discounts through coupons. Either upgrade to 16 GB RAM out of the box, or if you are adventurous, add something aftermarket for a slightly lower price tag.



#### Desktop
**BUILDING IS BETTER THAN BUYING** PLEASE, for the love of God, don't go out there and buy a pre-built desktop. Not only are they more expensive for the exact same pieces of silicon, they also rid you of the blissful DIY experience that is assembling your own PC.

Use the site https://pcpartpicker.com/ to configure something relatively painlessly. Use the American version instead of the Singaporean one, as many sellers are not listed in the latter.

At this price point, you can only afford 24 inch 1080p monitors, which are actually perfectly fine and cost around $150 per. Choose ones with IPS panels, as you will be looking at them side-on in a dual monitor configuration and you'd want half-decent colors.

**DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM COOLER MASTER** Please.

##### Recommendations
https://pcpartpicker.com/list/hmR4Dc This is 700 USD, which is around $1k when taking into account import tax and exchange rate. Feel free to get some things used if you exceed the budget slightly. Go to Sim Lim Square to pick up the parts. Local parts have warranty, whereas most things on Amazon and Newegg require you to ship items back to the U.S. yourself, which in my opinion is not worth it.



### $1500

#### Laptop

Get a Lenovo Legion with an AMD CPU and at least a GTX 1650 GPU. Other specs add to taste. Solid build quality and good quality control you'd expect from Lenovo and it's always on sale. Once again, go on HardwareZone to find coupons to reduce the price even further.



#### Desktop

This is the price point at which desktops really start to shine, because you now have the option of discrete GPUs.

https://pcpartpicker.com/list/HJsK8J This would be a reasonable build for this price range. You can game at 1440p 60hz pretty easily with a 5600 XT. Ahem... the GPU can be used for productivity purposes as well. If you are an avid gamer, however, you should consider switching out a 1440p monitor for a 1080p 144hz one instead.

**NOTE:** Using different models of monitors in a dual-monitor configuration can be risky, as the VESA mounts on the back of the monitors are not always inline, so you probably need to invest in an adjustable monitor arm for one of them.



### $2000

#### Laptop

Just get a desktop.

#### Desktop

https://pcpartpicker.com/list/WQrGXb Welcome to the good life. 1440p 144hz gaming with the graphics card to match.



## Conclusion

Stop at $1500 if you just want to develop software for school/AppVenture. Go any higher than $3000 and I recommend buying a desktop as well as a laptop and leave the latter in school. This is surprisingly economical as you minimize wear-and-tear on both machines and a quality Ryzen H-suffix CPU can last quite a few years.
